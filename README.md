# HeyJude

HeyJude is a music generating deep learning model that uses LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) which is a specialised Recurrent Neural Network(RNN). 
It helps The Beatles fans to be able to listen to songs that they would have made for us, again.
Our aim is to make a lyric generator to create a trained model that outputs lyrics after learning The Beatles lyrics and passes these lyrics into a speech converter using wavenet to create a complete song carrying the voice and words of The Beatles.
