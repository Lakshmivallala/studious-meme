# HeyJude

HeyJude is a song generating deep learning model that uses LSTM (Long Short Term Memory), a specialised Recurrent Neural Network(RNN). It helps the fanatics of The Beatles band to be able to listen to songs that they would have made for us.
Our aim is to create a trained model that is capable of generating lyrics similar to the previous lyrics of The Beatles. These lyrics are later on passed into a speech converter using wavenet to create a complete song, carrying the voice and words of The Beatles.
